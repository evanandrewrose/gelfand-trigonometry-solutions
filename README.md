*Trigonometry* by Gelfand and Saul is often recommended as a precalculus text for self-study.
However, those who are learning without the help of a teacher can struggle with the lack of solutions to exercises in the text. It is hoped that this repository will eventually contain a complete set of solutions that can be viewed as HTML or downloaded in PDF format.
